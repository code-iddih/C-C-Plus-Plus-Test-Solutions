# C++ Programming Tests ðŸš€ðŸ“Š

This repository contains solutions for two C++ programming tests:

1. **Text Justification (ðŸš€)**
2. **Matrix Transposition (ðŸ“Š)**

---

## ðŸš€ Test 1: Text Justification

### **Description**
Given a list of words and a maximum width, format the text such that each line contains as many words as possible without exceeding `maxWidth`. Each line should start with a lowercase letter.

### **Example Input**
```cpp
vector<string> words = {"This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."};
int maxWidth = 10;
```

### **Expected Output**
```
this is an
example of
text
justification
```

### **How to Compile & Run**
```sh
g++ text_justification.cpp -o text_justification
./text_justification
```

## ðŸ“Š Test 2: Matrix Transposition

### **Description**
Reads a matrix from the user, transposes it (flipping rows and columns), and prints both the original and transposed matrices.

### **Example Input**
```
Rows: 2
Columns: 3
Matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6
```

### **Expected Output**
```
Original matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6

Transposed matrix:
1 4
2 5
3 6
```

### **How to Compile & Run**
```sh
g++ matrix_transpose.cpp -o matrix_transpose
./matrix_transpose
```
